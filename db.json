            "ans": "Skin care is important for a number of reasons. Having a comprehensive daily skin care routine helps to keep your skin looking plump, firm and glowing. Choosing the right products for your skin type will also help to target specific concerns such as blemishes, fine lines, dryness, oiliness, redness and signs of aging. As we age, skin cell turnover becomes slower which can cause a loss of radiance, firmness and elasticity. A skin care routine will help to keep you looking more youthful for longer. Prevention is easier than correction, meaning that the earlier you start a skin care routine the better."

            "ans": "Your morning and nighttime routines will differ slightly, but there is a general recommended order in which you should apply your skin care products. The three most important steps are cleansing, moisturizing and applying SPF. If you want a more comprehensive routine, you can apply the following:\n\nAM:\n\n- Cleanser\n- Toner\n- Serum\n- Eye Cream\n- Spot Treatments\n- Moisturizer\n- Face Oil\n- SPF\n\nPM:\n\n- Cleanser (x2)\n- Toner\n- Serum\n- Eye Cream\n- Spot Treatments\n- Moisturizer\n- Retinol\n- Face Oil\n\nDon’t feel pressured to follow every single step – what works for your skin might not work for someone else’s. Find the best routine for you."

            "ans": "Using the wrong products for your skin type is arguably the most common skin care mistake that we can make. However, there are lots of other mistakes we may be carrying out on a daily basis that can cause our skin more harm than good. For example, dipping your fingers into product jars. By doing this, we are helping bacteria and dirt enter our products. Using a spatula, scoop or some sort of applicator helps to keep our formulas clean. Another common mistake to avoid is not wearing SPF every day. SPF is the most important step in your morning routine as it protects against the sun’s harmful rays and premature skin aging. Additionally, always remember to take your makeup off before bed and avoid over exfoliating the skin, as this can cause dryness and irritation. Make sure to keep an eye out for expiration dates too!"

            "ans": "Slugging is a TikTok viral trend that involves putting Vaseline (or any other petrolatum-based ointment) to your face as the last step in your evening skincare routine. There are both advantages and disadvantages to this technique – for those with dry or mature skin, applying these types of products can help to lock in moisture, protect the skin barrier and even minimize the appearance of wrinkles. However, for those with oily or acne-prone skin slugging may not be beneficial, as it can congest the pores."

            "ans": "Doing your research when building your skin care routine is essential. While it may be tempting to use as many ingredients as possible to try and maximize their benefits, some just shouldn’t be used together. Retinol, for example, is a powerhouse ingredient renowned for its anti-aging benefits. However, due to its potency, you should avoid mixing with vitamin C, AHAs, BHAs and salicylic acid to avoid irritation or dryness. Keep these ingredients separate in your routine and follow instructions carefully. For those with acne-prone skin, be careful when using benzoyl peroxide with tretinoin and retinol, as they may deactivate each other’s benefits. Additionally, using niacinamide and vitamin C may lower potency when combined, so be sure to use your products correctly."

Whether you have oily, dry, combination, normal or blemish-prone, there are a plethora of products to choose from to address your specific skin concerns. Using the wrong products can cause irritation or even worsen skin conditions. Another important tip is remembering to apply SPF every day. The sun can cause irreversible damage to your skin and health, so daily use is imperative – and never use a sunbed. Also, resist touching your facial skin to avoid transferring dirt and bacteria. Alongside these steps, maintaining a healthy diet, managing stress and avoiding smoking can all help to care for your skin."

            "ans": "Skin aging is inevitable, and not something to fear. If you are looking to address visible signs of aging such as wrinkles, the loss of elasticity and dullness, there are a number of things you can do. Cleansing, moisturizing and applying SPF are essential steps in your routine, while serums and exfoliants offer more targeted benefits. Incorporating a retinol into your routine can deliver smoothing and brightening benefits (just remember to build up your skin’s tolerance first), while antioxidants protect against aging environmental aggressors. Moreover, when applying your products resist tugging and pulling at the skin. Using gentle, upwards motions instead helps to promote a lifted effect."

Men tend to have thicker, oilier skin so using the right products is essential. Look for formulas that are non-comedogenic and feature ingredients such as niacinamide, salicylic acid and kaolin to help target excess oil and shine. Additionally, don’t forget to hydrate. For men who shave, hydration is key to prevent dryness."

            "discription": "Whether your concerns are with dark spots or fine lines and wrinkles, Jan Marini Luminate Face Mask visibly improves skin tone and texture from the first use. Packed with potent brightening and anti-aging ingredients, this mask resurfaces the skin to reduce the appearance of discoloration over time.\n\nAlpha-arbutin is a gentle yet efficient alternative to hydroquinone and lightens discoloration by preventing new pigment from forming. This star ingredient evens your skin tone and brightens your complexion for a radiant glow. Exfoliating lactic and mandelic acids exfoliate the skin and encourage cell turnover to immediately soften skin and smooth wrinkles and creases. Kaolin draws out impurities and helps hydrate skin so there is no dry or tight feeling after using the mask. Use this mask in conjunction with a brightening facial routine to erase pigmentation and gain a luminous, flawless complexion.",
